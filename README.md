MyWorld is a game world where spaces, items, and characters are placed. It is implemented in Java and uses Swing for the graphical user interface.

## Getting Started


### Usage

### Limitations
- The game support graphical representations of the target, and up to 10 players (in any 
  combination of human and computer).
- The game support up to 10 items.

```
<numRows> <numCols> <name>
<character_health> <character_name> <row1> <col1> <row2> <col2>
<pet_name>
<space_0_0> <space_0_1> ... <space_0_numCols-1>
<space_1_0> <space_1_1> ... <space_1_numCols-1>
...
<space_numRows-1_0> <space_numRows-1_1> ... <space_numRows-1_numCols-1>
<numItems>
<item_0_roomIndex> <item_0_damage> <item_0_name>
<item_1_roomIndex> <item_1_damage> <item_1_name>
...
```

- `<name>` is the name of the game world.
- `<character_health>` is the starting health of the character.
- `<character_name>` is the name of the character.
- `<row1>` and `<col1>` are the row and column of the upper left corner of the character's starting position.
- `<row2>` and `<col2>` are the row and column of the lower right corner of the character's starting position.
- `<space_i_j>` is the type of space at row `i` and column `j`.
- `<numItems>` is the number of items in the game world.
- `<item_i_roomIndex>` is the index of the room where the `i`th item is located.
